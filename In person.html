    <h2> Introduction </h2>

        <p> In a survey that was conducted by the US research institute Gensler Research Institute, around <br>
            90% of employees prefer to go back to work in an office environment. Employees who work in <br>
            offices need to have different skills such as the ability to exchange opinions, face to face <br>
            communication, and work as a team. Working from home can lead to stress as the cohabiting <br>
            and working places are similar. Although remote work has been dominantly applied starting from <br>
            the pandemic time, many professionals are looking forward to returning to their office environment, as <br>
            they miss working together with other colleagues, sharing their daily life, and getting inspired <br>
            in spaces specially designed to stimulate their creativity. 
        </p>

    <h2> Pros of In-person work environment </h2>
        
        <ol>
            
            <li> Conduct face to face meetings </li>

                <p> 
                    It is very essential for certain projects or works to conduct face-to-face meetings. Arranging <br>
                    personal meetings with our important clients can help us to easily market our ideas or proposals <br>
                    as our clients will have a sense of engagement and being part of the process. Face-to-face <br>
                    meetings also help our clients to see how we perform safely and naturally in a professional manner. <br>
                </p>


            <li> Better distribution of workspace</li>

                <p> 
                    On certain occasions, office work includes doing tasks in a highly optimized and functional workspace. <br>
                    This type of workspace is interesting as it allows the free circulation of employees in a fluid <br>
                    manner. In this way, it is easier to improve and increase the interaction of workers. Additionally, it <br>
                    also makes workers active on their duty as they will not be sitting on a chair for long hours like <br>
                    in remote work areas. <br>
                </p>

    <h2> Cons of In-person work environment </h2>

        <ol>

            <li> Lack of Privacy </li>

                <p> 
                    Introverted people may not like working in an office environment as a team. This is going to be a great <br>
                    disadvantage if we work in open spaces and offices, as many introverted employees can end up feeling <br>
                    uncomfortable. As a result of this, the overall productivity of the team is more likely to be below <br>
                    the expected value. <br>
                </p>

            <li> Increased stress and/or anxiety</li>
                
                <p> 
                    An employee is more likely to feel under pressure when working in an office environment either by our <br>
                    managers or other colleagues. This is going to result in lower productivity and capacity to work as it <br>
                    causes stress on the worker. They might result in rapid burnout of employees if not managed properly. <br>
                </p>
