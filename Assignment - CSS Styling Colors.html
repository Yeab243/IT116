    <h1> The World's Highest-Paid Athletes Earnings </h1>
    <h2> Neymar Junior</h2>
        <p>
            In May 2021, Neymar signed a contract extension that ties him to Paris Saint-Germain until summer 2025. In 2020, Neymar announced <br>
            an early exit from his contract with Nike's Jordan Brand and signed with Puma.  In 2021, Epic Games <br>
            announced that Neymar, an avid video gamer, would join the cast of "Fortnite" with an in-game skin. His transfer from Barcelona <br>
            to PSG stands as the most expensive in the world at $263 million, which the French club paid in full ahead of his signing. His new contract <br>
            is packed with performance bonuses, including a massive bump if PSG wins the Champions League. <br>
